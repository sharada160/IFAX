Alfresco source code:
1.	Unlike Linux command line, git clone option is not yet tried on Windows OS. Hence, please download source as .zip from github.
2.	Alfresco / acs-community-packaging
https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-community-packaging/tags
3.	Alfresco /alfresco-community-repo
https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/tags

6.	Input “clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true” in Goals & Run.
7.	This will start to build community repo (which will take 15-30mins).
8.	Once above compilation is completed, Edit acs-community-packaging/pom.xml file’s parent node as below:
<parent>
        <groupId>org.alfresco</groupId>
        <artifactId>alfresco-community-repo</artifactId>
        <relativePath>../alfresco-community-repo-8.339/pom.xml</relativePath>     this should be your community repo version
        <!--version>8.344</version-->
              <version>8.339</version>   this should be your community repo version
    </parent>
9.	Similar to steps 5/6, input “clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true” as Run configuration Goals & Run for acs-community-packaging.
10.	Upon successful build, check “acs-community-packaging-7.0.0-A13\distribution\target” folder for below files
alfresco.war
